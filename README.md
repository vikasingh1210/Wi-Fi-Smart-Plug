# Wi-Fi-Smart-Plug
Development of Wi-Fi smart plug including embedded, server and android code.
In this project I have developed a Wi-Fi based smart plug which will be place between the power supply socket and power cord of device.
  Using the android app we can configure the plug to our home wi-fi router. Once configured, app will create a controlling page for the plug. We can add as many smart plug to the same app. It will create different controlling pages for each plug. All the plugs configured from same phone will shown on a list which is opening page of app. Click on the device you want to control from the list. It will take you to the page of that device.
  Embedded code will be based on arduino IDE of ESP 8266 and atmega8. Due to unstable ESP 8266 we have use ATmega8 to take final desicion on opening and closing of relay
